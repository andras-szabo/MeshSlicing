1. Slicing a single triangle.

=== Create triangle
- Create said triangle from code.
- Add mesh renderer with default material, make sure it shows up.

=== Slice said triangle
- transform cut coordinates into object space
- calculate cut normal
- calculate intersections Iab, Ibc, Iac
- reject if there are no 2 intersections
- decide which kind of cut it is
- create new meshes based on that
+ interpolate normals
+ interpolate UVs
