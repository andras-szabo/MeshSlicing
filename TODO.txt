1. Slicing a single triangle.

=== Create triangle
o Create said triangle from code.
o Add mesh renderer with default material, make sure it shows up.

=== Slice said triangle
o transform cut coordinates into object space
	o well, first, let's _get_ said cut coordinates, via 2 mouse clicks-?
	o then actually transform them	
o calculate cut normal
	o forgot that we're technically in 3d now. so:
		o just rotate around _local_ forward

o calculate intersections Iab, Ibc, Iac
	= now the heavy lifting.

o reject if there are no 2 intersections

- decide which kind of cut it is
- create new meshes based on that
+ interpolate normals
+ interpolate UVs
